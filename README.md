## II - Detailed test case
## III - Code challenge 
- How to use the frame work
- Requirements
## IV - Findings 
- There is not limit in the amount of characters that can be added to each input box (just for email field)
- From UX perspective: Eyes icon is not getting opened when leeter a showing (TOOLTIP saying hide or not) or text
- When trying to login it takes to a new screen where I can either login or create a new account this is ok for new users but for existing users might being tedious following flow since prob they just have one mistake in their password and would like to know that asap
- Data is not being passed from one page to the other
